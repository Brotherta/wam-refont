# Wam-Studio

Wam-Studioâ€™s is an online tool for creating audio projects that you can imagine as multi-track music. Each track corresponds to a different "layer" of audio content that can be recorded, edited, or just integrated (using audio files for example). Some track can be used to control virtual instruments: in that case we record the sound that is generated internally by these virtual instruments (and played using a MIDI piano keyboard, for example). Tracks can be added or removed, played isolated or with other tracks. They can also be "armed" for recording, and when the recording starts, all other tracks will play along, while the armed track will record new content.
